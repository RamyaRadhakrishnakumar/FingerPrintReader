### Things to be worked on down the lane
1. Group placard and a 30sec script.
2. Make my finger print sensor function on my PCB.
3. Put together the video,progress report and the hardware together.
4. Demo the project and get remarks from the peer.
5. Depending on the review make final changes.
6. A powerpoint presentation on the project.
